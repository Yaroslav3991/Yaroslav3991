> *Code is a craft. Teams are a multiplier. I obsess over both.*

I'm a frontend engineer with **7+ years** building complex web applications — from internal HR systems to corporate travel platforms handling thousands of bookings, to banking interfaces used by millions. I've grown from writing my first React component to leading cross-functional teams, driving architecture decisions, and mentoring the engineers around me.

I believe the most underrated engineering skill is making your teammates better.

Currently exploring **AI + robotics** as a hobby — extending an open-source robot with computer vision, embedded AI models, and firmware improvements. It's where frontend thinking meets the physical world.

## 🤖 Robotics Hobby

Forking & extending an open-source robot project — going well beyond the original scope:

- 📷 **Camera module** — real-time visual input
- 🧠 **AI integration** — embedding ML models for autonomous behavior  
- ⚙️ **Firmware improvements** — motion control & hardware extensions
- 🔧 **New sensor capabilities** — expanding what the robot can perceive

> Frontend is where I work. Robots are where I think differently.
