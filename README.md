## 🤖 Robotics Hobby

Forking & extending an open-source robot project — going well beyond the original scope:

- 📷 **Camera module** — real-time visual input
- 🧠 **AI integration** — embedding ML models for autonomous behavior  
- ⚙️ **Firmware improvements** — motion control & hardware extensions
- 🔧 **New sensor capabilities** — expanding what the robot can perceive

> Frontend is where I work. Robots are where I think differently.
